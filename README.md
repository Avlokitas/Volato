# Volato

### Portfolio Optimization Tool

This is a robust, interactive portfolio optimization and analysis tool built using Python and Streamlit. It leverages quantitative finance techniques to help users build an optimal investment portfolio based on risk tolerance and return expectations.

Volato = Volatility + Portfolio

### Key Features

Efficient Frontier Visualization:
Generate and visualize portfolios across a spectrum of risk-return profiles, highlighting optimal Sharpe ratios.

Monte Carlo Simulations

Simulate thousands of random portfolios to analyze return distributions, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

KMeans Clustering on Simulated Portfolios

Identify distinct clusters of portfolio performance and risk using unsupervised machine learning.

Correlation Heatmaps & Matrices

Visualize inter-asset correlations to support diversification decisions.

Risk Contribution Analysis

Understand how each asset contributes to overall portfolio risk using marginal risk contribution metrics.

Value at Risk (VaR) & Maximum Drawdown

Quantify downside risk using VaR simulations and historical drawdown analysis.

Cumulative Portfolio Performance

Track the compounded performance of the optimized portfolio over time.

Asset Return Distributions

Compare return distributions for each asset to understand volatility and skewness.

Dynamic Asset Inclusion

Add or exclude Real Estate based on user preference to customize asset universes.

Optimization Summary Report

A detailed breakdown of allocation, return, risk, Sharpe ratio, VaR, and drawdown.

CSV Report Export

Generate and download a comprehensive report with asset weights and portfolio statistics.

## Technologies and Algorithms Used

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

Utilized for portfolio optimization using expected returns and covariance matrices.

Mean-Variance Optimization

Used to find the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio or a user-defined target return.

Monte Carlo Simulations

1000+ simulated portfolios to build a probabilistic model of performance.

KMeans Clustering (from scikit-learn)

Applied to portfolio simulations for pattern recognition and grouping.

Visualization Libraries

matplotlib and seaborn for plots (efficient frontier, correlations, drawdowns)

Streamlit for UI and interactive visualization

Statistical Techniques

Covariance matrix calculation (annualized)

Risk-adjusted return measures (Sharpe Ratio, VaR)

Drawdown analysis from cumulative returns

Data Handling

Price normalization and return conversion

Support for adding assets dynamically based on user input
